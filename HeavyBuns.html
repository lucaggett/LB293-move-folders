It's no wonder it's the toast of the aviation world!</h2>
        <p>The four-engine Heavy Bun has greater range at lower cost than other long-range wide-body commercial jetliners, and the aircraft’s extended reach and spacious interior also tailors it for VVIP and government use with highly discerning customers. It's the ultimate in upper crust travel. You could say it really knows how to rise to the occasion!</p>
        <p>There are four variants in Airbuns’ Heavy Bun Family: the Heavy Bun-200, Heavy Bun-300, Heavy Bun-500, and Heavy Bun-600. With the jetliners’ different fuselage lengths, this product line accommodates from around 250 to up to 475, providing extended operating ranges of up to 9,000 nautical miles. Talk about a long loaf! These aircraft are truly the yeast of your worries when it comes to long-distance travel.</p>
        <p>So whether you're flying for business or leisure, the Heavy Bun offers a premium experience that’s the best thing since sliced bread.
